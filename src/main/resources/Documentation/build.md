Build
=====

This @PLUGIN@ plugin is built with Bazel.

Clone (or link) this plugin to the `plugins` directory of Gerrit's
source tree. Put the external dependency Bazel build file into
the Gerrit /plugins directory, replacing the existing empty one.

```
  cd gerrit/plugins
  rm external_plugin_deps.bzl
  ln -s @PLUGIN@/external_plugin_deps.bzl .
```

From the Gerrit source tree issue the command:

```
  bazel build plugins/@PLUGIN@
```

The output is created in

```
  bazel-genfiles/plugins/@PLUGIN@/@PLUGIN@.jar
```

This project can be imported into the Eclipse IDE.
Add the plugin name to the `CUSTOM_PLUGINS` set in
Gerrit core in `tools/bzl/plugins.bzl`, and execute:

```
  ./tools/eclipse/project.py
```

To execute the tests run:

```
  bazel test plugins/@PLUGIN@:websession-broker_tests
```

How to build the Gerrit Plugin API is described in the [Gerrit
documentation](../../../Documentation/dev-bazel.html#_extension_and_plugin_api_jar_files).
